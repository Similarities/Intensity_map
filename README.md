# Intensity_map
data_evaluation, image calculation

calculates intensity map for a imaged laser focus. Chirped pulse duration via GVD can be added, for different recordings 
ND filter can be normed to a given one. Parameters see file. Background substraction could be improved by defining a smaller
ROI / since even a small amount of either negative values or positive values leads to a significant difference in the intensity map
by high amount of background area.
